    # Description of the project
    The application of mechanical joining technology in various branches of industry such as 
    automotive engineering, construction and white goods has increased considerably over the 
    last 20 years. In order to ensure further growth of these resource-saving joining processes, 
    new users must be able to design these processes quickly and without extensive process know-how. 
    This goal is pursued in the project proposal described here.
    \n Currently, there are two basic evaluation methods for the design of mechanical joints: 
    on the one hand the evaluation of the joint quality via the geometric characteristics 
    of the joint through cross section analysis and on the other hand the evaluation of 
    the joint via the testing of the strength by destructive testing. In principle, it is 
    known that the geometric characteristics such as interlock or neck thickness are directly 
    related to the strength of the joints but a quantitative correlation for different 
    material thickness combinations has not yet been investigated.

    geometrical characteristics of the joints as well as the material properties of the parts 
    to be joined. Data-based algorithms (machine learning) and analytical methods will be 
    investigated as prognosis methods. In this way, large experimental series of tests can be 
    avoided and the mechanical joints can be dimensioned many times faster.
    \n This project objective is achieved by determining the correlations between joint geometry 
    and strength on a large number of material thickness combinations experimentally and by 
    means of numerical simulation. On the basis of this data, learning algorithms can be 
    trained and the analytical methods can be validated in order to achieve the highest possible

    ### General
    Based on several parameters is it possible to analytically predict the strength of the joint. 
    These calculations are divided into two groups depending on the type of failure. From an 
    analytical viewpoint, it is possible to arrive at a solution for a failure that is dominated 
    by i) plastic deformation or ii) fracture. In the literature, various equations have been proposed 
    to predict the strength under the pull-out and the shear tensile loading. Based on 50 
    cases in our database for clinched joints, we defined the best performing analytical predictions. 
    Those four analytical approaches are implemented  this web application. 
    \n To know the strength of the joint in a particular loading condition, you need to calculate 
    the strength associated with  both failure modes. By comparing both the strengths, the lowest 
    strength serves as the predicted strength for the investigated joint configuration and loading condition.

    #### Top tensile test
    The deformation process during a top tensile test resembles a  **tube sinking process without a mandrel**. 
    This implies that the die-side sheet can be seen as a rigid ‘die’. The most basic formula applies when 
    the clinch is simplified to a tube.  However, it is known that this is an oversimplification resulting 
    in a underestimation of the maximum strength. According to Coppieters et al. [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263823111002679?casa_token=B9vJYddxRZwAAAAA:5qLzJcUV4gLqi2gJPE3CC38byUndCJ8UfmIoVFduI26Dy3b0XCoLJw55gXLHm4FdiM2AsEBYMekKXg), 
    the bottom part of the clinch contributes to the strength as it is radially compressed when assuming 
    a rigid die. In this project, however, some deficiencies of the model proposed in [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263823111002679?casa_token=B9vJYddxRZwAAAAA:5qLzJcUV4gLqi2gJPE3CC38byUndCJ8UfmIoVFduI26Dy3b0XCoLJw55gXLHm4FdiM2AsEBYMekKXg) were eliminated. 
    The improvement lies in a better definition of the basic shapes (tube and rod) that enter the analytical 
    calculation. In this web App, those shapes are defined by means of the geometrical parameters of the 
    clinching joint. It shown that this enhances the predictive accuracy of the analytical prediction as 
    reported in [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263823111002679?casa_token=B9vJYddxRZwAAAAA:5qLzJcUV4gLqi2gJPE3CC38byUndCJ8UfmIoVFduI26Dy3b0XCoLJw55gXLHm4FdiM2AsEBYMekKXg).
    This method is semi analytic due to the fact that the stress needs to be obtained from the FE-model (see 'Description of the calculation parameter').

    ### General
    For the strength prediction with the help of data-based algorithms, a large database is required. This is possible

    we replicate the experiments using a FE-software called 
    [Simufact forming](https://www.simufact.com/simufactforming-forming-simulation.html). In this project, 
    our aim was to find a trade-off between computational effort and predictive accuracy of the FE model 
    considering the three simulation steps (joining, pull-out and shear lap testing). Through existing functions 
    in this software, it was possible to automate the results transfer from the joining simulation to the strength 
    test. Which decreased the conversion time drastically.
    ### Simulation
    Before we can calculate the strength of the joint with the FE-software, the material must be characterized and 
    a friction model must be selected. It was shown in a previous project [1](https://cornet.efb.de/general-description-flow-curve-jbyf.html ) that the clinching forming simulation 
    is most accurate when measuring the flow curve using the stack compression test. Consequently, all 
    flow curves in this project are determined using the stack compression test. The combined friction 
    method is deeded an appropriate model for mechanical joining simulations. It is shown that this frictional 
    model enables to accurately simulate the metal flow during joining. The governing parameters of the 
    combined friction model were individually tuned for all 73 cases.
